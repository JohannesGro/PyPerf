Benchmarktool
=======================

The benchmarktool project aims to provide a base for writing standardized benchmarks.
For this purpose the project has two main parts. Firstly a runner executes the
benchmakrs and saves the result. Secondly a renderer reads the results and displays
it in a human readable manner.
It is possible to define a suite of benchmarks, run the suite on several systems
and compare the results.
