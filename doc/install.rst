Installation
============
For installing Pyperf and its dependencies we recommend an installation via pip.
But of course you can install it with the python setuptools instead.

Installation via pip (Python 2 and 3)
-------------------------------------
To install PyPerf with pip please download the wheel from our packageserver_ that corresponds to your
Python version.

For Python 2 use:

.. code-block:: Python

    python -m pip install path/to/the/pyperf-py2.whl

or for Python 3 use:

.. code-block:: Python

    python3 -m pip install path/to/the/pyperf-py3.whl

pip now installs PyPerf and its dependencies to your python installation.


Installation via setuptools (only Python 2)
-------------------------------------------
To install PyPerf with the python setuptools please download the egg from our packageserver_.
You can install it with:

.. code-block:: Python

    python -m easy_install path/to/the/pyperf-py2.egg

easy_install now installs PyPerf and its dependencies to your python installation.
